        <p>Hello! I'm Adil Arhan, a 12th standard student and an HSC candidate studying at Southpoint School and College in Chittagong. I’m passionate about learning and constantly exploring new things, especially in the fields of physics and web development.


In my free time, you’ll often find me playing cricket, a hobby I truly enjoy. A few months ago, I decided to dive into HTML, and I’m excited to continue growing my skills as a beginner web developer. I believe in the power of learning and always look forward to discovering new concepts that can help me improve and apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios.

Thanks for visiting my portfolio! Feel free to explore my work, and let's connect if you’re interested in collaborating or learning more.

    <h2>My Skills</h2>
    

    
    <p>As a beginner in web development and an eager learner, I've started building my foundation in <strong>HTML</strong>, with a growing interest in expanding my knowledge into CSS, JavaScript, and beyond. Here are some skills I’ve developed so far:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>HTML</strong>: I began learning HTML a few months ago and have built several basic projects. I am focused on mastering the structure of web pages using semantic HTML tags.</li>
        <li><strong>Basic CSS</strong>: Alongside HTML, I’ve started experimenting with <strong>CSS</strong> to style web pages. My current knowledge includes layout techniques such as Flexbox and Grid.</li>
        <li><strong>Problem Solving & Critical Thinking</strong>: As a <strong>physics enthusiast</strong>, I have a natural inclination towards problem-solving and logical thinking, which I apply to both my studies and coding projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Cricket</strong>: While not a technical skill, my involvement in <strong>cricket</strong> has taught me teamwork, perseverance, and leadership—skills that I value in all areas of life, including my personal development as a web developer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'm excited to keep building my skill set and tackle more advanced challenges as I grow in my coding journey. Stay tuned as I continue to learn and improve!</p>
